## üèÅ Introduction

ŸÖÿ≥ŸàŸÇÿ¨Ÿä (Masoukji) is a comprehensive platform for discovering, buying, and selling recipes across food, health, and wellness categories. The app connects users with experts and enthusiasts, offering a seamless experience from recipe discovery to ingredient delivery. Designed for scalability, security, and user-friendliness, ŸÖÿ≥ŸàŸÇÿ¨Ÿä is available on Android, iOS, and web platforms.

---

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built using a modular, layered architecture for maintainability and scalability:

- **Presentation Layer:** Flutter-based UI for Android, iOS, and web. Organized into screens, widgets, and themes.
- **Business Logic Layer:** Controllers and providers manage state, user actions, and business rules.
- **Data Layer:** Repositories and data sources handle API communication, local storage, and caching.
- **Backend (not included):** The app communicates with a RESTful API for authentication, recipes, orders, and payments.
- **Assets:** Centralized management of images, videos, and language files for localization.

**Typical Flow:**
1. User interacts with the UI (e.g., searches for a recipe).
2. Controller processes the action, fetches data from the repository.
3. Repository communicates with remote API or local cache.
4. Data is returned, processed, and displayed in the UI.
